ART LIST (Updated 10 NOV 2009):

HIGH PRIORITY:
player sprite - frames 32x32 each - just walking left/right and standing left/right
blocks - 16x16 - standard, explosion... more to come later.
	will need animation for explosion block - 48x48 with center being the center of the explosion.
a full tileset without doodads - tiles 16x16 - NO slants and should essentially fill the whole tile
at least one enemy sprite - size variable, make in multiples of 16 (ie: 16, 32, 48, etc.)
	for initial enemy, basic basic and forth walking is plenty
spawning point (active) - 32x32 
	spawning point animation
blocked off spawning (inactive) - 32x32

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
generic in-game 'treasure' image fit in 16x16 image--does not have to fill it up
other tilesets - again
tileset doodads - multiples of 16, do not have to fill
other enemy sprites - multiples of 16
	details to come later
in-game switches and doodads - multiples of 16, specifics of what's needed to come later


LOW PRIORITY: - details to come later
hp display 
money display (icon for coin)
border for text boxes
overworld map(s)
active spawning point animation
animation for enemy spawning


More to come...
