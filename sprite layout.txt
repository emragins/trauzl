Sprite Sheet Layout:

Row One: Move Left
Row Two: Move Right
Row Three: Standing and any waiting animations
Other rows: one complete animation per row... even if only one or two frames

Most important to note are the order of the left and right animations since those will be parsed 
completely by code, ideally without any extra work.  Other animations will probably need some work
anyway to tell the code what it's supposed to be.  This is completely non-standard to my knowledge, 
but should work well for a single project (I hope.)

Build sprite sheets with 1 pixel of padding between each frame (easier on you), and for consistancy,
on all the sides, too.


Example:
- and | indicate 1 pixel of padding

-----
||||| LEFT - 4 frames in this example
-----
||||| RIGHT
-----
|||		OTHER - 2 frames in this example
---
|||		OTHER
---
